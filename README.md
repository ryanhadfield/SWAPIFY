# Swapify

### Swapify is a React App that allows users to list, connect, and swap items with other nearby users in an easy to use and intuitive web application.

---

## Description

 Swapify allows users can upload images and descriptions of items they are looking to swap onto their profile.  Users can browse our database of other swappable items in a simple, fun and familiar UI.  Once a match is made by users both selecting each other's items both parties are alerted of the match. The users are then able to use our swap-chat feature to communicate with one another and sort out the details of the swap.  Once the swap has been made each user can rate the other on the experience and add to their Swapify rating.  Enjoy & Get Swap'n!

This app is deployed on [Heroku](https://swapify-us.herokuapp.com/).

Our setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.


---
## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Usage

- Users login to the site using their Google login info.
